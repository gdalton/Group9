 * Programmers: Matthew Greenlaw, Dalton Gray (Add your name here)
 * Class Number: CS-300
 * Date: 22NOV17
 * Purpose: The Report Manager (RM) class will contain all of the functions
   necessary to create all of the reports required by ChocAn, their members, and
   their Providers. This class will generate reports for the aforementioned
   parties weekly, as well as provide functionality for ChocAn managers to
   generate reports on-demand.
